# mpa-langstrings
**mpa-langstrings** is a plugin for the [Joomla!](https://joomla.org) CMS to display localized language strings inside of articles or custom modules.  


## Installation
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Piets/mpa-langstrings/releases/latest)
2. Install it as usual in the Joomla Administrator Area
3. Enable the newly installed "Content - MPA.net: Language Strings" plugin


## Usage
Inside of your articles insert `{mpa-lang YOUR_LANGUAGE_STRING}` where you want the localized string to be inserted.  


## Examples
`{mpa-lang JANUARY}` would be replaced by the localized name of the first month, so "January" in *en-GB*, and "JÃ¤nner" in *de-DE* and so on.
